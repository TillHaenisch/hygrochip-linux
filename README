# A tool for reading from Hygrochip humidity sensors under Linux

This is a simple program that queries
[Hygrochip](http://www.hygrochip.com/) humidity sensors from Linux,
particularly from the Raspberry Pi.  It was developed and tested with
the HYT-271, but it should work with the other models that use the
same sample code.  See [my blog
post](http://david.wragg.org/blog/2013/01/rpi-humidity.html) for more
details.

To build, just do:

    $ make

And then to run it:

    $ ./hyt-read
    50.582920 21.314777

The first value returned is the relative humidity as a percentage, the
second is the temperature in degrees C.

By default, it uses the I2C bus name that is correct for the IO header
pins on the Raspberry Pi revision 2.  You can supply an alternative
bus name, e.g.

    ./hyt-read bcm2708_i2c.0

The file `munin_plugin.sh` contains a script contributed by Florian
Heiderich to use this program with the munin monitoring tool.
